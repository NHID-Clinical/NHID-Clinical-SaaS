"""
NHID-Clinical Trace Generator
================================
Runs the failure injection harness against a FastAPI server (or mock),
collects event output, and generates 10 canonical NHID-Clinical trace
files in markdown format.

Each trace covers a single distinct failure mode, following the canonical
trace post template (v1). Output files go to /traces/.

Usage:
  # With a live server:
  python tests/trace_generator.py

  # Without a server (generates synthetic traces from policy engine only):
  python tests/trace_generator.py --offline

  # Custom output directory:
  python tests/trace_generator.py --output-dir /path/to/traces

NHID-Clinical is a voluntary open proposal. CC BY 4.0.
Not an accredited standard. Not a regulatory requirement.
