replay attempt (deterministic)

input: identical event stream
constraints: no external calls
result: PASS

---

failure observation

The execution_context.pipeline_version field was null, making it impossible to reconstruct which pipeline version processed this call during a post-incident audit.

---

implication

- Missing pipeline_version breaks cross-incident correlation — you cannot identify whether multiple failures share a common pipeline version.
- ATR-01 violations do not halt execution, creating a silent audit gap that accumulates across sessions.
- Procurement and compliance reviewers require complete provenance chains; a missing pipeline_version fails an enterprise audit review.

---

classification

state machine: DISCLOSED → DISCLOSED (no state change, ATR-01 is non-blocking)
event store: INCOMPLETE — execution_context.pipeline_version missing from event record
failure coverage: ATR-01 detected; LOG_ONLY action; pipeline_version gap recorded
replay integrity: DEGRADED — provenance chain incomplete for this event

---

next iteration

- Add execution_context validation to the server startup check — fail fast if pipeline_version is not configured.
- Implement an ATR-01 compliance score across sessions: % of events with complete execution_context.
- Alert on ATR-01 violation rate exceeding 0% — any audit field missing is a governance regression.
