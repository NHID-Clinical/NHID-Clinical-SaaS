failure observation

The pipeline completed successfully but with a DBC-01 deceptive artifact violation recorded as a partial failure — the most operationally dangerous failure mode because the session appears normal from the outside while governance boundaries are breached internally.

---

implication

- partial_failure=true is invisible to the human operator receiving the call — only the audit trail captures the violation.
- Partial failures accumulate silently across sessions; a 5% partial failure rate across 10,000 calls represents 500 undetected governance violations.
- The decision to not halt on DBC-01 (LOG_ONLY vs ESCALATE_HUMAN) must be explicit policy, not default behavior.

---

classification

state machine: DISCLOSED → DECEPTION_FLAGGED (partial_failure=true, session continues)
event store: Complete — partial_failure=true and boundary_violations[] correctly populated
failure coverage: DBC-01 detected as partial failure; LOG_ONLY action; session tainted but not terminated
replay integrity: PASS — partial failure is deterministically reproducible

---

next iteration

- Implement a partial_failure rate dashboard across all active sessions.
- Define an explicit policy rule: after N partial_failure events in a session, escalate to human.
- Add DBC-01 partial failure to the automated alert threshold: >0 partial failures per session triggers ops review.
