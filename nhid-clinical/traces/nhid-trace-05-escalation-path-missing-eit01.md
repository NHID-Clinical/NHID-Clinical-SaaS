failure observation

Human operator explicitly requested escalation but the AI system had no functioning transfer path, stranding the caller and violating the NHID-Clinical safe-failover requirement.

---

implication

- An escalation path that exists in configuration but is not tested in production is functionally equivalent to no escalation path.
- The EIT-01 violation must be surfaced to operational dashboards immediately — a blocked escalation is a patient/member safety risk.
- The TwiML fallback message must include an alternative contact method (callback number, hours) when transfer fails.

---

classification

state machine: DISCLOSED → ESCALATION_FAILED
event store: Complete — EIT-01 critical violation recorded
failure coverage: EIT-01 detected; ESCALATE_HUMAN action returned with fallback TwiML
replay integrity: PASS

---

next iteration

- Add an escalation path health check to the server startup validation.
- Implement a circuit-breaker pattern for escalation path availability.
- Update TwiML fallback message to include a direct callback number when transfer is unavailable.

NHID-Clinical is mapping where deterministic orchestration breaks in real-world healthcare voice AI systems.
